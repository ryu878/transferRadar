# Announcement: Discontinuation of Free Bots for Bybit 
I regret to inform that I will no longer be updating or maintaining my free trading bots for the Bybit exchange. This decision comes after a deeply disappointing experience with Bybit's unethical practices, particularly regarding their affiliate program and their handling of user earnings.

Despite fully complying with Bybit's rules, including completing KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements, my affiliate earnings were abruptly terminated without valid justification. Bybit cited "one IP address" as the reason, a claim that is both unreasonable and unfair, especially for users in shared living environments or using shared internet connections. This behavior demonstrates a lack of transparency and fairness, and it has eroded my trust in Bybit as a reliable platform.

As a result, I have decided to shift my focus to BingX, a more transparent and user-friendly exchange that aligns with my values of fairness and integrity. Moving forward, I will be developing and updating trading bots exclusively for BingX, and I encourage my community to explore this platform as a viable alternative to Bybit.

I want to thank everyone who has supported my work and used my free bots for Bybit. Your trust and feedback have been invaluable, and I hope to continue providing value to the crypto community through my future projects on BingX. Stay tuned for updates, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need assistance during this transition.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

You can check how it works here: https://t.me/transferRadar
or here: https://discord.gg/mZFsY4VDbA

# Installation

To install it you can create conda environment first, like this:
```
conda create --name transferradar -c conda-forge python=3.11
```
Then activate it using command
```
conda activate transferradar && alias -s py=python && clear
```
Then you have to install requests and pytelegrambotapi using commands:
```
pip install requests
pip install pyTelegramBotApi
```
Create wallet files:

```
btc_wallets_data.json
eth_wallets_data.json
trc20_wallets_data.json
```
in this JSON format:
```
[
  {
    "wallet": "WALLET_ADDRESS",
    "title": "Exchange Name/Wallet Label"
  }
]
```
And then you can run scripts this way:
```
btc_check.py
```
```
eth_check.py
```
```
trc20_check.py
```
Of course you also need Telegram bot API key and also you have to set your telegram bot as admin of your tg channel.
